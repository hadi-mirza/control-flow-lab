# exercise-05 Fibonacci sequence for first 50 terms

# Write the code that:
# 1. Calculates and prints the first 50 terms of the fibonacci sequence.
# 2. Print each term and number as follows:
#      term: 0 / number: 0
#      term: 1 / number: 1
#      term: 2 / number: 1
#      term: 3 / number: 2
#      term: 4 / number: 3
#      term: 5 / number: 5
#      etc.

# Hint: The next number is found by adding the two numbers before it

first_number = 0
second_number = 1

for i in range(0,51,1): # range from 0-100 with step 1
    print(f'term: {i} / number: {first_number}')
    third_number = first_number + second_number
    first_number = second_number
    second_number = third_number
